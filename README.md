# Study Break w/ Spotify Web Player

Study Break is a web app that allows you to take control of your study sessions, creating a personalized listening session telling you when it's time to study and when it's time to take a break. All you have to do to get started is log in with your Spotify account!

Simply select the kind of music you want to study to, the type of music you want to take a break to, and how long you want each activity to go on for. With this information, we create a listening session that will play your desired study music for the amount you set, then automatically change to your break music for the amount you set, signalling that it is time to take a break!

Built with Angular and express, and backed by DynamoDB.
